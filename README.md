I built **SmartCalc**, a modern, dark-themed calculator app inspired by the Windows Calculator. It supports all basic arithmetic operations with a sleek UI built using **Java and XML**.

## 🔧 Features:
- ➕ Basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- 🔁 Clear (`C`) and Backspace (`⌫`) options
- 💯 Percentage support
- 🧮 Decimal and double zero support
- 📲 Real-time expression evaluation using `exp4j`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
